PROJECT STATUS
This is still in beta as we forge ahead to 1.0. It is playable from beginning to end, but we're still polishing the later parts of the mod.
It includes all of the items, enemies and bosses from the original mod, plus a growing number of new additions. Development is focused on revamping enemies, game balance, and new content.

GAME MANUAL:
--------------------------------------------
*Create a new character named Red Cloud.

*Adventure Mode should stay checked in the TSORC mod config options to play with the custom map.

*Read signs in the order you come to them.

*Read all item tool-tips for hints and game clues, especially mod items.

*Don't move vanilla NPCs like the Wizard, Mechanic or Goblin Tinkerer until you've found them in game. Modded NPCs may be moved.

*On death, you will drop all your Dark Souls and have one chance to recover them. For a more forgiving experience, you can turn this off in the mod's Config options.

*New dodge roll action with i-frames can be bound to any key in the mod's config options.

*Multiplayer is supported but we're still ironing out bugs. Post issues you find under #bug-reports. Thanks! The map supports up to 3 players. Class diversity recommended.
